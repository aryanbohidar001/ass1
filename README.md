# Simple Arithmetic Operations Program

This repository contains a Python script (`ass1.py`) that performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) on two user-provided numbers.

## Features

- **Addition**
- **Subtraction**
- **Multiplication**
- **Division** (with handling for division by zero)

## Task 2: Personalized Greeting

This task prompts the user for their first and second name, then prints a personalized greeting.

**Example Code:**
```python
first_name = input("Enter your first name: ")
second_name = input("Enter your second name: ")
print(f"Hello {first_name} {second_name}! Welcome to the Python program")
```

**Sample Output:**
```
Enter your first name: John
Enter your second name: Deo
Hello John Deo! Welcome to the Python program
```

## Usage

1. **Run the script**:

   ```bash
   python ass1.py
   ```

2. **Input two numbers** when prompted.

3. **View the results** for each arithmetic operation.

## Example

```
Enter the first number : 10
Enter the second number : 5
Addition:  15
Subtraction:  5
Multiplication:  50
Division:  2.0
```

If the second number is zero, the script will notify that division by zero is not allowed:

```
Enter the first number : 7
Enter the second number : 0
Addition:  7
Subtraction:  7
Multiplication:  0
Division by zero is not allowed
```
